Python functions to retrieve lists of article URLs. Currently this includes:

* Category membership, including custom category depth
* Wikidata Query Service queries, with "?item" for the Wikidata item ID and "?article" for the article URL

Future plans include:
* Compositions, which are either unions or intersections of existing lists, including other compositions
